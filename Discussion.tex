\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Time Synchronization }

Like the effect of TOA detection error, time synchronization error maybe also occur flip problem when computing the node sequence in LPSBL system, then lead to localization error.
Traditional time synchronization protocol, such as RBS, TPSN, and FTSP, can achieve synchronization less than 100ns. 
Compared with the the effect of TOA detection error, time synchronization error has little effect on the LPSBL system.

\subsection{Multiple Source Localization}

Localizing multiple, simultaneously active sources is a more difficult problem. 
In order to avoid conflict of several source, multiple source localization must be able to uniquely identify the signature of each acoustic source, which is beyond the capability of this paper. 
So we will not do too much discussion about it in this paper.
We just take an example, if the several targets are set as shown in Fig. 3, then we can calculate the location of the targets 
because the acoustic source I is far enough from source II and the single from them can be distinguished. 
So the smartphones close to effective area I could handle source I, and another smartphones close to effective area II could handle source II. 
The Fig. 3 also describes system scalability.
We can use a range to divide the large-scale area into to a smaller area that is large enough to cover the coverage of the acoustic source's signal.
And the small area can be handled as our algorithm proposed by preceding part of the paper.

\subsection{Energy Efficiency}

Energy efficiency is another issue in distributed acoustic sensor networks.
Most of the time, acoustic sensor nodes keep asleep until the acoustic source appears in its sensing area.  
The smartphones node near the acoustic source detect the acoustic signal, then alert its neighbour smartphones to prepare for receiving the signal.
In this way, the proposed LPSBL system can save energy of acoustic sensors, then prolong the service life of distributed acoustic sensor networks.
